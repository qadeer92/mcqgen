      "Python is literally eating the programming world. It is\n",
      "growing in popularity and usage in ways that are pretty\n",
      "much unprecedented in the history of computers.\n",
      "There is a huge variety of scenarios that Python\n",
      "excels in. Shell scripting , task automation , W eb\n",
      "development  are just some basic examples.\n",
      "Python is the language of choice for data analysis\n",
      "and machine learning , but it can also adapt to create\n",
      "games and work with embedded devices.\n",
      "Most importantl y, it's the language of choice for\n",
      "introductory computer science courses  in\n",
      "universities all around the world.\n",
      "Many students learn Python as their first programming\n",
      "language. Many are learning it right now, many will\n",
      "learn it in the future. And for many of them, Python will\n",
      "be the only programming language they need.\n",
      "Thanks to this unique position, Python is likely going\n",
      "to grow even more in the future.\n",
      "The language is simple, expre ssive, and it's quite\n",

      "different fields.\n",
      "Technically spea king it is an interpreted language that\n",
      "does not have an intermediate compilation phase like\n",
      "a compiled language, for example C or Java.\n",
      "And like many interpreted languages, it is dynamically\n",
      "typed, which means that you do not have to indicate\n",
      "the types of the variables you use, and variables are\n",
      "not tied to a specific type.\n",
      "This has pros and cons. In particular we can mention\n",
      "that you write programs faster , but on the other hand\n",
      "you have less help from the tools to prevent possible\n",
      "bugs and you will find out about some kinds of issues\n",

      "programs\n",
      "There are a few different ways to run Python\n",
      "programs.\n",
      "In particular , you have a distin ction between using\n",
      "interactive prompts, where you type Python code and\n",
      "it's immediately executed, and saving a Python\n",
      "program into a file, and executing that.\n",
      "Let's start with interactive prompts.\n",
      "If you open your terminal and type  python , you will\n",
      "see a screen like this:\n",
      "This is the Python REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop)\n",
      "Notice the  >>>  symbol, and the cursor after that. You\n",
      "can type any Python code here, and press the  enter \n",
      "key to run it.\n",
      "For example try defining a new variable using\n",
      "name = \"Flavio\"\n",
      "and then print its value, using  print() :10print(name)  \n",
      "Note: in the REPL, you can also just type  name ,\n",
      "press the  enter  key and you'll get the value\n",
      "back. But in a program, you are not going to see\n",
      "any output if you do so - you need to use\n",
      " print()  instead.\n",
      "Any line of Python you write here is going to be\n",
      "executed immediately .\n",
      "Type  quit()  to exit this Python REPL.\n",
      "You can access the same interactive prompt using the\n",
      "IDLE application that's installed by Python\n",
      "automatically:\n",
      "11This might be more convenient for you because with\n",
      "the mouse you can move around and copy/paste more\n",
      "easily than with the terminal.\n",
      "Those are the basics that come with Python by\n",
      "default. However I recommend to install IPython ,\n",
      "probably the best command line REPL application you\n",
      "can find.\n",
      "Install it with\n",
      "pip install ipython  \n",
      "Make sure the pip binaries are in your path, then run\n",
      " ipython :\n",
      " ipython  is another interface to work with a Python\n",
      "REPL, and provides some nice features like syntax\n",
      "highlighting, code completion, and much more.\n",
      "The second way to run a Pytho n program is to write\n",
      "your Python program code into a file, for example\n",
      " program.py  :12\n",
      "and then run it with  python program.py  \n",
      "Note that we save Python programs with the  .py \n",
      "extension, that's a convention.\n",
      "In this case the program is executed as a whole, not\n",
      "one line at a time. And that's typically how we run\n",
      "programs.\n",
      "We use the REPL for quick prototyping and for\n",
      "learning.\n",
      "On Linux and macOS a Python program can also be\n",
      "transformed into a shell script, by prepending all its\n",
      "content with a special line that indicates which\n",
      "executable to use to run it.\n",
      "On my system the Python executable is located in\n",
      " /usr/bin/python3  , so I type  #!/usr/bin/python3   in\n",
      "the first line:13\n",
      "Then I can set execution permission on the file:\n",
      "chmod u+x program.py  \n",
      "and I can run the program with\n",
      "./program.py  \n",
      "This is especially useful when you write scripts that\n",
      "interact with the terminal.\n",
      "We have many other ways to run Python programs.\n",
      "One of them is using VS Code, and in particular the\n",
      "official Python extension from Microsoft:14\n",
      "After installing this extension you will have Python\n",
      "code autocomp letion and error checking, automatic\n",
      "formatting and code linting with  pylint , and some\n",
      "special commands, including:\n",
      "Python: Start REPL  to run the REPL in the integrate d\n",
      "terminal:\n",
      "Python: Run Python File in T erminal  to run the\n",
      "current file in the terminal:15\n",

      "(View -> Command Palette, or Cmd-Shift-P) and type\n",
      " python  to see all the Python-related commands:16\n",
      "Another way to easily run Python  code is to use repl.it,\n",
      "a very nice website that provides a coding\n",
      "environment you can create and run your apps on, in\n",
      "any language, Python included:\n",
      "Signup (it's free), then under \"create a repl\" click\n",

      "code:\n",
      "Once you have some code, click \"Run\" to run it on the\n",
      "right side of the window:18\n",
      "I think repl.it is handy because:\n",
      "you can easily share code just by sharing the link\n",
      "multiple people can work on the same code\n",
      "it can host long-running programs\n",
      "you can install packages\n",
      "it provides you a key-value database for more\n",
      "complex applications19Python 2 vs Python 3\n",
      "One key topic to talk about, right from the start, is the\n",
      "Python 2 vs Python 3 discussion.\n",
      "Python 3 was introduced in 2008, and it's been in\n",
      "development as the main Python version, while\n",
      "Python 2 continued being maintained with bug fixes\n",
      "and security patches until early 2020.\n",
      "On that date, Python 2 support was discontinued.\n",
      "Many programs are still written using Python 2, and\n",
      "organizations still actively work on those, because the\n",
      "migration to Python 3 is not trivial and those programs\n",
      "would require a lot of work to upgrade those\n",
      "programs. And large and important migrations always\n",
      "introduce new bugs.\n",
      "But new code, unless you have to adhere to rules set\n",
      "by your organization that forces Python 2, should\n",
      "always be written in Python 3.\n",
      "This book focuses on Python 3.20The basics of working\n",
      "with Python\n",
      "V a ri a b l e s\n",
      "We can create a new Python variable by assigning a\n",
      "value to a label, using the  =  assignment operator .\n",
      "In this example we assign a string with the value\n",
      "\"Roger\" to the  name  label:\n",
      "name = \"Roger\"\n",
      "Here's an example with a number:\n",
      "age = 8\n",
      "A variable name can be composed by characters,\n",
      "numbers, the  _  underscore character . It can't start\n",
      "with a number . These are all valid  variable names:\n",

      "Other than that, anything is valid unless it's a Python\n",
      "keyword . There are some keywords like  for ,  if ,\n",
      " while ,  import  and more.\n",
      "There's no need to memorize them, as Python will\n",
      "alert you if you use one of those as a variable, and\n",
      "you will gradually recognize them as part of the\n",

      "s t a t e m e n t s\n",
      "We can expression  any sort of code that returns a\n",
      "value. For example\n",
      "1 + 1\n",
      "\"Roger\"\n",
      "A statement on the other hand is an operation on a\n",
      "value, for example these are 2 statements:\n",
      "name = \"Roger\" \n",
      "print(name)  \n",
      "A program is formed by a series of statements. Each\n",
      "statement is put on its own line, but you can use a\n",
      "semicolon to have more than one statement on a\n",
      "single line:22name = \"Roger\"; print(name)  \n",
      "C o m m e n t s\n",
      "In a Python program, everything after a hash mark is\n",

      "I n d e n t a t i o n\n",
      "Indentation in Python is meaningful.\n",
      "You cannot indent randomly like this:\n",
      "name = \"Flavio\"  \n",
      "    print(name)  \n",
      "Some other languages do not have meaningful\n",
      "whitespace, but in Python, indentation matters.\n",
      "In this case, if you try to run this program you would\n",
      "get a  IndentationError: unexpected indent  error,\n",
      "because indenting has a special meaning.\n",
      "Everything indented belongs to a block, like a control\n",
      "statement or conditional block, or a function or class\n",
      "body . We'll see more about those later on.23Data types\n",
      "Python has several built-in types.\n",
      "If you create the  name  variable assigning it the value\n",
      "\"Roger\", automatically this variable is now\n",
      "representing a String  data type.\n",
      "name = \"Roger\"\n",
      "You can check which type a variable is using the\n",
      " type()  functio n, passing the variable as an\n",
      "argument, and then comparing the result to  str :\n",
      "name = \"Roger\" \n",
      "type(name) == str #True\n",
      "Or using  isinstance()  :\n",
      "name = \"Roger\" \n",
      "isinstance(name, str) #True\n",
      "Notice that to see the  True  value in Python,\n",
      "outside of a REPL, you need to wrap this code\n",
      "inside  print() , but for clarity reasons I avoid\n",
      "using it\n",
      "We used  the  str  class here, but the same works for\n",
      "other data types.\n",
      "First, we have numbers. Integer numbers are\n",
      "represented using the  int  class. Floating point\n",
      "numbers (fractions) are of type  float :24age = 1 \n",
      "type(age) == int #True\n",
      "fraction = 0.1 \n",
      "type(fraction) == float #True\n",
      "You saw how to create a type from a value literal, like\n",
      "this:\n",
      "name = \"Flavio\"  \n",
      "age = 20\n",
      "Python automatically detects the type from the value\n",
      "type.\n",
      "You can also create a variable  of a specific type by\n",
      "using the class constructor , passing a value literal or a\n",
      "variable name:\n",
      "name = str( \"Flavio\" ) \n",
      "anotherName = str(name)  \n",
      "You can also convert from one type to another by\n",
      "using the class constructor . Python will try to\n",
      "determine the correct value, for example extracting a\n",
      "number from a string:\n",
      "age = int( \"20\") \n",
      "print(age) #20 \n",
      " \n",
      "fraction = 0.1 \n",
      "intFraction = int(fraction)  \n",
      "print(intFraction) #025This is called casting . Of course this conversion migh t\n",
      "not always work depending on the value passed. If\n",
      "you write  test  instead  of  20  in the above string,\n",
      "you'll get a  ValueError: invalid literal for int()\n",
      "with base 10: 'test'   error .\n",
      "Those are just the basics of types. We have a lot more\n",
      "types in Python:\n",

      "and more!\n",
      "We'll explore them all soon.26Operators\n",
      "Python operators are symbols that we use to run\n",
      "operations upon values and variables.\n",
      "We can divide operators based on the kind of\n",
      "operation they perform:\n",

      "arithmetic operators\n",
      "comparison operators\n",
      "logical operators\n",
      "bitwise operators\n",
      "plus some interesting ones like  is  and  in .\n",
      "Assignment operator\n",
      "The assignment operator is used to assign a value to\n",
      "a variable:\n",
      "age = 8\n",
      "Or to assign a variable value to another variable:\n",
      "age = 8 \n",
      "anotherVariable = age  \n",
      "Since Python 3.8, the  :=  walrus operator  is used to\n",
      "assign a value to a variable as part of another\n",
      "operation. For example inside  an  if  or in the\n",
      "conditional part of a loop. More on that later .27Arithmetic operators\n",
      "Python has a number of arithmetic operators:  + ,  - ,\n",
      " * ,  /  (division),  %  (remainder),  ** \n",
      "(exponentiation) and  //  (floor division):\n",
      "1 + 1 #2\n",
      "2 - 1 #1\n",
      "2 * 2 #4\n",
      "4 / 2 #2\n",
      "4 % 3 #1\n",
      "4 ** 2 #16\n",
      "4 // 2 #2\n",
      "Note that you don't need a space between the\n",
      "operands, but it's good for readability .\n",
      " -  also works as a unary minus operator:\n",
      "print(-4) #-4\n",
      " +  is also used to concatenate String values:\n",
      "\"Roger\" + \" is a good dog\"\n",
      "#Roger is a good dog\n",
      "We can comb ine the assignment operator with\n",
      "arithmetic operators:\n",
      " += \n",
      " -= \n",
      " *= \n",
      " /= \n",
      " %= \n",
      "..and so on28Example:\n",
      "age = 8 \n",
      "age += 1\n",
      "# age is now 9\n",
      "Comparison operators\n",
      "Python defines a few comparison operators:\n",
      " == \n",
      " != \n",
      " > \n",
      " < \n",
      " >= \n",
