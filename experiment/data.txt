Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to vastly improve the metaverse by automating intelligent decision-making and creating highly customized user experiences. Web3, with its distributed network architecture, provides consumers with enhanced privacy and security when conducting financial transactions online [1], [2], [3]. In addition, the immutable data storage and transfer mechanisms made possible by blockchain technology guarantee data security and integrity. In the age of Web3, generative AI technologies like Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) have the capacity to become productivity tools by addressing problems with digital assets and content productin and filling in essential gaps in Web3â€™s evolution [4]. Generative AI technologies are expected to accelerate the advent of the Web3 era by offering more reliable and convenient productivity tools for Web3 creators and contributors.

With the advent of generative AI technologies, such as ChatGPT, there has been widespread attention in the industry towards its creativity and flexibility. The efficiency and quality of content production and dissemination may be greatly improved with the help of ChatGPT based on deep learning models, which can generate content in a wide variety of contexts and fulfill a wide range of needs. In addition to these benefits, ChatGPT can facilitate eliminating obstacles, enhancing human understanding and creativity, and generating priceless insights and innovations. ChatGPT can also use multi-modal AI technologies to analyze, interpret, and generate information in greater detail by leveraging different perceptual modes [5], [6], [7]. This will allow for real-time perception and response to content and provide flexible feedback, ultimately leading to the creation of more rich and diverse forms of content. Technologies such as virtual characters, speech synthesis, and image generation will be integrated into the reconstructed content production process.

Technology advancements in AI for Generative Content (AIGC) have led to the emergence of critical technologies like ChatGPT as components of the metaverse engine layer, considerably easing the process of creating high-quality material in the metaverse [8]. Currently, the metaverse's content scale has not yet met user demands, and the cost of building metaverse spaces remains high, affordable only for a few companies. Moreover, virtual spaces created with substantial investments often lack excitement, openness, and refinement. Yet, the price of constructing metaverse environments can be drastically decreased if AI can assist creators in lowering the barriers, such as providing consistent scenes with basic descriptions [9], [10], [11]. Generative AI will elevate the quantity of content in the metaverse to a new level and drive the resurgence of industries such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). This is especially true in the age of AIGC, when it will be crucial for all platforms producing or planning to construct metaverse spaces to determine whether or not the metaverse can use the power of AI to first achieve richness of material, and so attract users even in the absence of users. In this paper, the technical key of generative AI and its application and potential in the metaverse are reviewed around the issue of technological breakthroughs in the metaverse. Moreover, the emerging technology ChatGPT based on generative AI is explored to lower the technical threshold for realizing creativity in the metaverse era.
